# Installation

Depending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install
this cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release
is the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid
Chef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.

## From the Opscode Community Platform

To install this cookbook from the Opscode platform, use the *knife* command:

    knife cookbook site install ruby-build

## Using Librarian

The [Librarian][librarian] gem aims to be Bundler for your Chef cookbooks.
Include a reference to the cookbook in a **Cheffile** and run
`librarian-chef install`. To install with Librarian:

    gem install librarian
    cd chef-repo
    librarian-chef init
    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE
    cookbook 'ruby-build',
      :git => 'git://github.com/fnichol/chef-ruby-build.git', :ref => 'v0.1.0'
    END_OF_CHEFFILE
    librarian-chef install

## Using knife-github-cookbooks

The [knife-github-cookbooks][kgc] gem is a plugin for *knife* that supports
installing cookbooks directly from a GitHub repository. To install with the
plugin:

    gem install knife-github-cookbooks
    cd chef-repo
    knife cookbook github install fnichol/chef-ruby-build/v0.1.0

## As a Git Submodule

A common practice (which is getting dated) is to add cookbooks as Git
submodules. This is accomplishes like so:

    cd chef-repo
    git submodule add git://github.com/fnichol/chef-ruby-build.git cookbooks/ruby-build
    git submodule init && git submodule update

**Note:** the head of development will be linked here, not a tagged release.

## As a Tarball

If the cookbook needs to downloaded temporarily just to be uploaded to a Chef
Server or Opscode Hosted Chef, then a tarball installation might fit the bill:

    cd chef-repo/cookbooks
    curl -Ls https://github.com/fnichol/chef-ruby-build/tarball/v0.1.0 | tar xfz - && \
      mv fnichol-chef-ruby-build-* ruby-build
